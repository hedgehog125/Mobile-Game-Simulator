=== Self plagiarism: ===
= Images =
NFTs bad: Assets/Images/I hate NFTs lineup/nftsBad.png (fully made beforehand)
Dessert Destruction tiles: Assets/Images/NFTMatch/Tiles : almost entirely made beforehand (when I was 10 :P), they're supposed to be bad so it's a good fit

= Code =
tools/lotsOfImages and imageToData: upload and download logic partly made beforehand, required modification to work outside of my framework
