# Mobile-Game-Simulator
It was originally planned to be a satire of mobile games, but I ended up taking a more of an educational angle.

Like Ninja's Tale it's also something I made for my course. Although this one's my year 1 FMP.

# How to run
Download a build from the releases tab (or on [Itch.io]()) or build it using Unity 2020.3.4f1.
