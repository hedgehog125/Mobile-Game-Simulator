# Mobile-Game-Simulator
Mobile Game Simulator is the second major game I produced as part of my Games Development Level 3 course. The original idea was that it was a satire of the malpractices common in mobile games (loot boxes, fake multiplayer etc.). However, I discovered writing satire is hard. So because of time constraints, I pivoted towards more of an educational tone.

I think the game was a bit too experimental in the end, as the uniqueness of the idea meant I didn't really have any similar games to compare it to. And those could have helped improve the design.

Since this game, I've tried to get more of a balance of originality for the games I make. I went too far the other way with [Lego Jungle Dash](https://github.com/hedgehog125/Lego-Jungle-Dash), but I think [Gravity's Great Betrayal](https://github.com/hedgehog125/Gravitys-Great-Betrayal) will be a good balance, since I think its concept of switching gravity is underexplored, but not completely *unexplored*.

# How to run
Download a build from the releases tab (or on [Itch.io](https://hedgehog125.itch.io/mobile-game-simulator )) or build it using Unity 2020.3.4f1.

You can also play [online](https://hedgehog125.github.io/Mobile-Game-Simulator/ ) but I really wouldn't recomend it.
